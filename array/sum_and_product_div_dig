# Divisibility by Product/Sum of Digits
# Problem statement
# You are given an array of positive integers, arr, of size array_length. How any elements in arr are perfectly divisible by either the product or the sum of their digits?
# Example 1
# Input
# 1 303
# Output
# 0
# Explanation
# Sum of digits of 303 = 6, the product of digits of
# 303 = 9
# 303 is not divisible by 6 or 9, hence the output is
# 0.
# Example 2
# Input
# 2
# 14
# 7
# Output
# 1
# Explanation
# arr contains two elements, 14 and 7 Sum of digits of 14 = 5, product of digits of 14 = 4
# 14 is not divisible by 5 or 4. Sum of digits of 7 = 7. Product of digits of 7 = 7
# 7 is divisible by 7

#     print(arr_length[i])
# arr_length1 = arr_length
